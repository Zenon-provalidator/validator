2) Why you want to become a validator for GovGen and AtomOne

- Provalidator has cast a ‘No with Veto’ vote on proposal #82 and a ‘No’ vote on proposal #848, reflecting our belief that these proposals diverge from the foundational principles of Cosmos and fall short of their intended objectives. In light of this, we are eager to collaborate with GovGen and AtomOne, contributing to the community with the aim of pooling our expertise. Together, we aspire to forge a path forward, leveraging our collective experience to realize shared goals.
